I propose a command based language for the textual interface of uppaal. More precisely the design of the language will look as follows:

Command ::= <Load> | <Save> | <Start> | <Set> | <Add> | <Drop> | <Check> | <Show> | <Select> | <Help> | <Quit>
Load ::= 'load' <Filename>
Save ::= 'save' <Saveable' <Filename>
Start ::= start <Mode>
Set ::= 'set' <PCDATA> <PCDATA>
Add> ::= 'add' <Addable'
Drop ::= 'drop' <Droppable>
Check ::= 'check' <query> ?
Show ::= 'show' <Showable>
Select ::= 'select' <Number>
Help ::= 'help' <PCDATA>?
Quit ::= 'quit'
Filename ::= (<PCDATA> '/') + <PCDATA>
Saveable ::= 'document' | 'queries' | 'trace' | 'result'
Showable ::= 'transitions' | 'transition' <Number> | 'current-state' | 'document' | 'process' <PCDATA> | 'options' | 'option' <PCDATA> | 'queries'
Addable :== 'query' <Query>
Droppable ::= 'option' <PCDATA> | query <Number>
Mode ::= 'edition' | 'simulation' | 'checking'
Query ::= '"'<CTLSpec>'"' '"'<PCDATA>'"'
CTLSpec ::= <Monop> <Query> | <Query> <Binop> <Query> | <Comp> | <PCDATA>
Comp ::= PCDATA> <Compop> <PCDATA>
Monop ::= 'not' | 'A[]' | 'A<>' | 'E[]' | 'E<>'
Binop ::= 'or' | 'and' | '-->'
Compop ::= '==' | '!='
PCDATA ::= [ a-zA-Z0-9.-]+
Number ::= [0-9]+

The command line interface will start in mode edition where it can only load a document, add queries to the query list and display informations about the model. By entering the command 'start' the user can either switch to simulation or to checking mode which both require a document to be started. In simulation mode the user can show the current state, the current list of transitions, the information about a particular transition, a particular clock or select a transition which will be added to the trace. At any time he can save the trace to a file or switch back to edition or to checking mode. In checking mode the user can only add queries to the list, check them against the engine or check a particular query against it. At any time the user can save the result of his checking or go back to one of the two other modes. At any time he can ask for some help about all commands or about a specific one, he can also set an option, drop a query or an option and quit the command line interface either by typing 'quit' or by pressing the keys control + D.
